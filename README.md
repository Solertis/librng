#libRNG

libRNG is a public domain collection of random number generators for C++.

## Acknowledgements

The generators presented here are largely adapted from the public domain C sources in David Jones's manuscript _Good Practice in (Pseudo) Random Number Generation for Bioinformatics Applications_ ([pdf](www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf)). The interface is inspired by Haskell's [System.Random](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.2/html/libraries/random-1.0.0.3/System-Random.html).
